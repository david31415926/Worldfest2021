              "I submitted an image of gnocchi bolognese with spinach, which is an Italian dish that is very frequently
              made in my family. Gnocchi dates back to around 9000 BCE, not attributed to a single location. Its
              original name was "gnocco," which means "node" and can also refer to "knuckles" -- referring to the shape
              of the pasta. Gnocchi began using potato as a primary ingredient in the 16th century when they were
              brought from the Americas. Prior to the introduction of potatoes in Europe, gnocchi was comprised of cold
              water and flour. My family is from Sicily, and the region of Italy is now responsible for roughly 50% of
              the country's potato production (potatoes are mostly grown in Southern Italy). Over the centuries, people
              have experimented with its ingredients, adding other flours such as cornmeal and seminola as well as other
              foods (eg. spinach and pumpkin). Bolognese, also known as ragú, is a meat-based sauce that is used as the
              main flavor component to many pasta dishes, and originated in Bologna, Italy. It is not typically served
              with gnocchi (rather with lasagna or tagiatelle), but it is typical of Italian-Americans to mix components
              of Italian cuisine. Gnocchi alla bolognese is a dish that combines multiple aspects of Italian cuisine and
              is a significant part of my family's meal repertoire."

              is well known for its cuisines and wine, so it's no wonder they call it God's Kitchen! The most famous
              part of Sicilian cuisine is the pastry dishes, notably cannoli (means "little tube" in Sicilian). Cannoli
              are tube-shaped fried pastry shells with a filling usually made with ricotta but can be custard as well.
              For toppings, I sprinkled chocolate chips throughout the ricotta and added candied fruit on the ends.
              Cannoli were historically prepared to celebrate the Carnevale, a festival that takes place in Italy before
              Lent begins. Sicily is also one of the largest wine producers in Italy and is known primarily for Marsala
              wines, which is used in making cannoli shells."

              "This is lotería, or "lottery" translated from Spanish. It is a traditional game of chance like bingo that
              is played in Mexico at events like parties or fairs. Traditional lotería is played on 4 x 4 boards of
              tiles that each correspond to a card. The cards are essentially the equivalent of the balls in bingo and
              are randomized through shuffling. A card is drawn from the top of the deck and read aloud, at which point
              players must mark their spot on their board if they have the same picture on their board. Usually each
              card shows a different person, object, or animal and players mark the board with uncooked beans, however
              actual plastic pieces have been used more in recent years. The winner can be determined in a multitude of
              ways, the most common being the first person to get 4 in a row or sometimes the first person to fill their
              board, depending on how the players wish to play the game. The specific version of lotería shown in this
              image is a version that pictures the many different jobs and activities in pre-Columbian Mexican
              societies, such as the Maya and the Aztec peoples. It also uses grains of maize as marking pieces to
              recognize the importance of this product to these ancient societies."

              "For my submission, I chose my great-grandmother’s Albanian cookbook. My mom immigrated to the US from
              Albania when she was 22, and this was one of the items she brought from home. Especially right now, when
              we can’t travel, cooking Albanian food is one of the biggest ways my family maintains ties with our
              culture and relatives. A few of the pages I added pictures of are some of my family’s favorite recipes:
              The first is pastiço, a pasta-like dish that my sister loves, the second is petulla, a pretty basic type
              of fried dough that can be used for sweet or savory desserts and appetizers, and the last is byrek
              (probably what we make the most), and it’s basically a filo-dough casserole that usually includes leeks
              and other vegetables. In my visits to Albania over the years, I’ve always noticed that food is used as a
              method of hospitality and respect. There seems to be an unspoken rule that a guest’s plate can never be
              left empty, and the medieval Albanian code of honor (the Best) mandates that guests and strangers are
              looked after with gratitude (often expressed with invitations to meals!)."

              meal, so I used WorldFest as an opportunity to prepare it myself to show to others. Dolmades are a
              traditional Greek food composed of grape leaves stuffed with rice and meat topped off with avgolemono
              sauce (a traditional greek sauce made of lemons and eggs). The origins of Dolmades are quite unclear.
              Although unlikely, some like to believe they may date back to 335 BC when Alexander the Great besieged
              Thebes causing a shortage of food. It is said the Thebans began to wrap the little meat they had in
              leaves, thus creating the first dolmades. A more likely origin may result in creation coupled with
              increasing popularity during the Ottoman Empire that likely spread to both Turkey, Greece, and other
              neighboring countries after the fall of the Empire. Such an origin would demonstrate the cultural
              similarities between Turkey and Greece that are specifically seen in cuisine."

              nine national parks in Taiwan. It is the only park in Taiwan with hot springs and volcanic geography.
              Yangmingshan is situated between Taipei and New Taipei City on the northern edge of the Taipei basin.
              During the Qing Dynasty and Japanese occupation of Taiwan, officials frequently set fire to the mountain
              range in attempts to protect its rich sulfur deposits from thieves. As a result, Yangmingshan was referred
              to as Caoshan (草山), or “Grass Mountain,” due to its abundance of grass and lack of trees. After World War
              II, Yangmingshan was given its name to commemorate Wang Yang Ming, a famous Chinese scholar of the Ming
              Dynasty. Natural resources and scenery of Yangmingshan also began to undergo planned development and
              utilization. Today, Yangmingshan is known for its hot springs, diverse wildlife and vegetation, sulfur
              crystals, and hiking trails. "

              "I chose to create Italian-inspired crepes for my submission. Crepes are a prominent aspect of both French
              and French-Canadian cuisine. My family and I grew up very close to friends who were French, so I was
              immersed in their culture and cuisine from a young age. My family is Sicilian, so Italian cuisine has
              always been present in our household. I decided to create a dish that combines both aspects of these
              cultures that are familiar to me. My French-Italian fusion crepe consists of an oregano batter, filled
              with rosemary prosciutto cotto, kale, spinach, and both mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I topped the
              crepe with dried basil from a local organic market. Although the flavors were different than traditional
              crepes, I really enjoyed the Italian twist. "

              Kielbasa is a cultural dish that originally from Germany. In general, this dish is thought to bring good
              luck when eaten. This tradition was brought over to Pennsylvania and Ohio by German immigrants and has
              been widely adopted. Within my family, we eat sauerkraut and kielbasa every New Years Day in order to
              bring good luck in the New Year. In terms of making this dish, the process involves adding sauerkraut,
              kielbasa, and brown sugar to a roaster and cooking inside of the oven. Recipes differ from region to
              region. "

              "Pictured here is 火锅, or hotpot, a main dish popular in China. Hotpot is prepared by placing raw
              ingredients in a pot of hot broth and cooking the ingredients. The ingredients are cut into thin slices to
              reduce the cooking time. Oftentimes, we eat the cooked food with dipping sauce (as you can see in the
              upper left hand corner of this picture). With hot pot, there are endless variations of this dish. Starting
              with the soup base, popular broth flavors include spicy, tomato, herbal, mushroom, and pork bone. My
              personal favorite is mushroom broth; however, because the rest of my family love spicy broth, we
              compromise with the tomato broth! My family likes to put enoki mushrooms, baby bok choy, shrimp, lamb and
              beef slices, and fish balls in our hot pot. However, many more foods can be enjoyed with hot pot such as
              tofu, mussels, duck blood, and beef aorta. Just like how there are numerous broth variations and
              ingredients, one can create their unique dipping sauce from popular condiments such as soy sauce, sesame
              oil, chili powder, and oyster sauce. My go-to dipping sauce takes a combination of sesame paste, peanut
              butter, and a tad bit of soy sauce, giving the sauce a tangy flavor that enhances the overall hot pot
              experience. And that is exactly what hot pot is: it is more than just a dish, it is an opportunity for
              friends and family to sit around a pot and relax while talking. As a child, gathering around the table for
              dinner was a central part of my family (and is important in Chinese culture). However, as we grew older,
              because of my sister and I’s different practice times, my family rarely had the opportunity to eat dinner
              at the same time. Hotpot gives my family the chance to come together as a family. "

              from Poland, these pieces have significance to my origins and family history. All of the pottery was made

              to 6,000 B.C. and has roots in the town of Boleslawiec. The pottery pictured embodies the traditional
              patterns as they are inspired by the peacock and have the royal blue color. In Europe, peacocks are seen
              as a symbol of royalty and wealth, which inspired the ceramic artists to base their pottery on the designs

              "This is Irish Stew! This dish is recognized as Ireland’s national dish, a wholesome meal which can be
              traced back to the early 1800’s. Traditional Irish Stew was originally known as “peasant food,” made from
              whatever animals and crops were most readily available. The meat-vegetable mixture most often consisted of
              lamb or mutton, potatoes—unsurprising considering the abundance of potatoes being farmed during this time
              period—onions, and other root vegetables. In later years, the original recipe was brought to the Americas
              and evolved to cater to more accessible ingredients. Today Irish Stew is sometimes made using beef,
              carrots, turnips, barley, and even beer! I’ve grown up eating my grandmother’s Irish Stew—her ancestors
              were from Donegal, Ireland. "

              uncovered so much about this country. From its history to its culture and language we were able to see
              what a multifaceted country this was and, along with that, how it was intertwined in some of the most
              pivotal moments in history. A poster seemed like the right fit to uncover some, of their voluminous

              the infamous duet of Ferdinand and Isabella hiring Columbus and kicking of the Golden age, to Spain's fall
              around the time of the War of Spanish succession. They set the precedent and drove other countries to

              church it was only right that we included catholic holidays like Corpus Christi, All saints day, and more.

              <p>"Wiener schnitzel, although originating from northern Italy, is actually one of Austria’s national
                dishes. Overtime, the Viennese have made it their own, perfecting their recipe and modes of preparation.
                It is a 3-6 ounce veal (meat of a calf) cutlet covered in a breaded crumble and fried until golden
                brown. It is popularly served with a few lemon slices and an Austrian vinegar potato salad. However, the
                most interesting part about wiener schnitzel is its cooking process. Before coating the meat in the
                breadcrumbs, one must tenderize it by hammering the cutlet with a meat mallet - effectively flattening
                it. It causes the dish to expand in surface area - sometimes being served to extend across the entirety
                of a large plate. Wiener schnitzel is prevalent among Viennese kitchens whether they be of taverns, posh
                restaurants, or common households. It is a staple meal throughout Austria and its name even indicates it
                as such; Wiener schnitzel meaning “Viennese schnitzel” as if patented and proclaimed as Austrian
                cultural property."</p>

              <p>"The image presented here are sweet rice balls with sesame, which is a very important food in Chinese
                culture. They are commonly eaten during the Chinese New Year in order to celebrate the event. The food
                has a rice outside layer and a sweet sesame filling. They are generally served in warm and in bowls of
                water. The word in Chinese sounds similar to "get together," which is what is done when they are eaten.
                Furthermore, the round shape represents luck and prosperity in Chinese culture, and, when eaten during
                the Chinese New Year with family, means the new year will be very fortunate. Personally, my parents
                often make them during the holidays, although we sometimes eat them every now and then as a way to
                connect. Overall, the sweet rice balls with sesame are very important to Chinese culture and to me
                personally."</p>

              In 2014, I had the privilege of attending the renowned Estonian Song and Dance Festivals. These

              in the country and occur every five years over the summer. The traditons started in 1869 and celebrate
              Estonian culture and identity.
              At the Dance Festival, private dance groups audition and practice their routines years in advance.
              Throughout the performance they move
              into different patterns like circles or lines that the crowds can see from above in their seats. The Song
              Festival occurs the next day
              and many dancers also sing at this event. Thousands of singers gather in the festival dome and the
              beautiful melodies can be heard for miles.

              of place in my otherwise Westernized
              life. When I was younger, I thought it was just a decoration, like a painting, but Asian. But over time, I
              gradually became more aware of what
              it symbolized. It is a connection between me and my ancestors, between my American family and my Chinese
              relatives. At first it merely appears
              Chinese: it's made of red paper, a traditional medium of Chinese handicraft, and is surrounded by the
              exaggerated, serrated edges typical of
              that art form. But it means something personal too. In the years of the Chinese zodiac, I was born in that
              of the goat, or "yang". My Chinese
              grandfather gave it to my parents at that time, as a reminder of what I was and what I came from. It was a
              way for him to leave a part of
              himself with us. It was a way to show that no matter what, despite being an ocean and continent away, we
              were still the same family, and
              that I was still its little goat. And in Chinese culture, a family cannot be broken. It must stay
              together, and this little red goat is a sense
              of our family's continuation, continuing to move, just as the years and the zodiac themselves do. Things
              change, but they never end."</p>

            <p>"Attached is a photo of my family's Pascha basket, part of the traditional Russian Orthodox Pascha
              (Easter) celebration. The basket contains
              eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, Pascha bread, kulich (sweet bread), salt, and kielbasa (traditional Slavic
              sausage). It also has a candle and an Icon
              of Jesus' resurrection. We make this every year to be blessed and then eaten after the Paschal church
              service, which happens at midnight on
              Easter. It means a lot this year as we are unable to go to church. It is very important, as all the
              elements are symbolic of elements of the
              Orthodox faith, as well as the fact that we fast from meat and cheese for all of Lent (40-50 days). It is
              a very exciting time when Pascha
              comes around and we can eat meat again."</p>

              first in their families to be born
              in America. These pickles are my great-grandma’s recipe. The pickle is traditionally a huge part of German
              culture. Most German food is pickled
              and high in vinegar content such as sauerkraut or pickles. Additionally in German culture, on Christmas, a
              glass pickle ornament is hidden on
              the tree, and the first child that finds it gets a special present or a treat. We still make these
              traditional German pickles today to honor
              our culture and where we came from."</p>

            <p>"Here is a photo of my twin brother, Carlos, holding a beheaded tiger piñata at on our birthday. Although
              a cursed image, it remains cultural.
              In Mexico, piñatas are a traditional decoration and activity for nearly any joyful celebration, including
              birthdays and New Years. Traditionally,
              they are paper mâché, cardboard, and wire constructions in the shape of stars with ribbons hanging down
              from the tips. However, they have been
              modernized and now often depict characters, animals, objects, and various pop culture figures, and come in
              a variety of colors. During a
              celebration, one person fills the piñata with candy or gifts and keeps it hung on a string above the
              guests' heads, and the guests take turns
              hitting it with a broomstick until the candy spills out, which they then collect. Carlos hit this piñata a
              bit too hard and it flew right off
              the string with its head off, but after re-hanging it and a few more turns, candy spilled out as planned."

            <p>"This is a TikTok that my sister and I made to celebrate a bit of our culture. I am Chinese and the
              outfit that I am wearing (in the last part
              of the video) is a cheongsam/qipao, a traditional Chinese dress. It was originally popularized by the
              Manchus during the Qing dynasty and at the
              time was called changpao. It was generally a fairly loose fit that hung in an A-line shape. It has since
              been modernized and adapted to a tighter
              fit and a higher slit. This new version was popularized by celebrities and high class members of society.
              Today, many versions of this traditional
              dress can be found. Most of them feature a delicate floral pattern, but there are many alternative designs
              from solid colors to polka dots to
              anything in between. It is an extremely popular article of clothing during festive seasons like the Lunar
              New Year and a typical garment worn
              by the bride during at least a part of her wedding."</p>

              dance costumes in the modern day vary widely, and a common type consists of loose fitting pants and a top
              while others are more elaborate and
              consist of multi-layer dresses/parts. Due to Westernization there has been a delicious mixing of ballet

              not the case, as kids eagerly await the
              arrival of los reyes magos, or the three kings on January 6th. It is believed that this is the day that
              the three wise men, called Gaspar,
              Baltasar, and Melchor in Spanish, visited baby Jesus and gave him gifts. The festivities begin on January
              5th, and the streets become filled with
              people, as they observe the parade processions and await the calbagatas de los reyes magos, which are huge
              floats that show reenactments of each
              of the three kings. The procession also includes musicians and other cabalgatas with children who throw
              candy and goodies into the crowd. Later
              , on the evening of January 6th, children lay out food for the reyes magos to eat and also leave their
              shoes out for the reyes magos to put
              candy in."</p>

              is hit with small drumsticks. This
              version is especially extravagant but it can be a simple as a cylindrical, hollow log with slits. It is
              played by hitting the log on the least
              fixed points, which is why there are slits, producing a louder sound than a typical log would.
              Historically, it is typically played in dances
              and performances, and I have personally played it at the world festival at Centennial Lane Elementary
              School when I was in 4th grade."</p>
